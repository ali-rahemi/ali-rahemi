            <h3 className="collection-text">Our subconscious is a black cat in the night. Black cat sometimes in a hole called archetype
                n history, to every corner
                He spends the rest of his time looking for the garbage he finds in the basement
                We have dropped it.
                A long time ago, after some reading about Walter
                Benjamin's thoughts (Benjamin Sch√∂nflies Bendix Walter)
                The foundation of the upcoming collection began
                in my brain. Some time later, in the continuation
                of my thoughts, I made a decision one night
                I chased my black cat to the hole he was moving
                towards and the next day by the same
                I followed him and wandered in the desert which
                was in a way the area of both of our lives.
                I will pass through the garbage left in it. I
                rummaged through the discarded garbage for a
                long time.
                I split the plastic bags and poured their contents
                out in front of me. Sometimes my clothes get dirty
                It was smelly and sometimes in the middle of the
                desert I encountered a wall that I did not know behind
                What is! But the result of my adventure among the
                garbage was valuable items that I sometimes see
                he ate. After some time, I decided to take with
                me the things that are worth recycling or reuse
                take home You won't believe what valuable items
                are sometimes found in the desert. sometimes
                Back home, a neighbor found his lost item among
                my valuable trash
                He found it again and admitted that he has been
                looking for it for a long time. Now, after a long time of littering
                I have come to believe that sometimes people don
                't even know what they are throwing away
                They hold things.
                The next collection is a collection of some of our desert recycling.
                Throughout this journey, the black cat was my guide.</h3>
