                <p className="abaut-text">Hi, I'm Ali. Since my teenage years, I became interested in photography by using
                    a camera that I received as a gift from my aunt. Since then, as a curious teenager,
                    I started capturing images of everything I saw. Many of my early photos resemble visual pollution.
                    Now, I am a graduate student in psychology and my education in psychology,
                    studying and participating in advanced photography courses has helped me to
                    look at photography in a new way. Now, photography is one of the most powerful
                    ways for me to understand and create. Capturing an image is now a process of creating
                    for me, and it doesn't always happen.
                    For me, photography is a way to express personal perspectives
                    and emotions. In photography, I am looking for beauty, ugliness,
                    and concepts that have value for me to capture in an image. I hope
                    my photos provide an opportunity for reflection, thought, and questioning.<br />
